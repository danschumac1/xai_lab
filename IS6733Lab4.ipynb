For the analogy $Paris:France :: Nairobi:x$, finds that $x = Kenya$. These embeddings can also amplify sexism implicit in text. For instance, $\\vec{man} - \\vec{woman} ≈ \\vec{computer \\space programmer} - \\vec{homemaker}$. The same system that produced reasonable answers to the previous examples offensively answers \"man is to computer programmer as woman is to $x$\" with $x = homemaker$.\n",
